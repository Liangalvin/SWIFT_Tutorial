# Swift Tutorial
*by Alvin Liang, Joel Konjin, and Shoshanah Weisinger*

We have attempted to cram our heads with everything Swift in one day. Here is what we know about it!

Swift is Apple's newest programming language for OS X and iOS. It was made as a simpler replacement to Objective-C, and also works alongside existing app code in Objective-C. Just one line of code in Swift can accomplish the same thing as multiple lines of code in Objective-C.
